    "Hi Team,\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to flag an issue that started occurring yesterday and has been causing increasing concern on our side. Since early yesterday morning, we’ve been seeing intermittent timeout errors when users reach the checkout stage and attempt to complete payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue doesn’t seem to happen on every transaction, which makes it harder to pin down, but when it does occur, the checkout API fails to respond within the expected time window. As a result, users are unable to complete their payments and their orders are left in an incomplete state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has already resulted in several customer complaints reaching our support team, with users reporting that their payments either hang indefinitely or fail after a long wait. Some users have tried multiple times before abandoning the transaction altogether. We’re concerned this could start having a measurable impact on conversion rates and overall revenue if it continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, we haven’t been able to identify a clear pattern. The timeouts appear across different devices and browsers, and we’re seeing them both during peak and non-peak traffic hours. We also haven’t made any significant changes on our end that would obviously explain this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that checkout and payments are business-critical for us, we’d really appreciate it if your engineering team could investigate this issue as a priority. Specifically, we’d like to understand whether this could be related to recent deployments, infrastructure capacity, or any downstream service dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please let us know:\n",
    "\n",
    "What you believe the root cause might be\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether the issue is ongoing or has stabilized\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are any immediate mitigation steps we should take on our side\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimated timeline for a full resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be helpful for us to have an ETA by end of day, as we need to update internal stakeholders and decide whether to communicate proactively with customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks in advance for your help and please let us know if you need logs or additional details from our side.\n",
